# Tips for Job Searching
Congratulations on deciding to apply for jobs or internships! I _highly_ recommend you use the resources provided by the [UP Career Center](https://www.up.edu/career/). The resources they provide are the most up to date. Here are some of my specific suggestions:
- Create your resume. Get feedback on your resume from as many people as possible! Use your resume to help populate your LinkedIn profile. Connect with your colleagues as well as your profesors. Get feedback on your LinkedIn Profile too!
- Identify jobs/internships that interest you. One way to do this is through informational interviews. I like to find people to interview through LinkedIn. You'd be surprised how easy it is to set up informational interviews. 
- Book an appointment with the [UP Career Center](https://www.up.edu/career/). Again - they have all the latest tips and tricks!
