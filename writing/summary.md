## Review

# Timely reviews
Any feedback provided in the review process must be timely. Long delays in giving comments and suggestions to improve a scientific paper can de-motivate the writer and delay the dissemination of meaningful research. Here are my suggested guidelines for appropriate review timelines:
- Conference abstract - 5 working days
- Poster - 5 working days
- Draft manuscript - 10 working days
- Dissertation/thesis - 10 working days
