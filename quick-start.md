# Welcome
Welcome to academic research! It is nothing like you've done in class - little guidance, no right answers, which is why I love it. I hope you learn to love it too. 

## Research Guidelines
If you haven't already, you should read my guidelines for undergraduate researchers. This helps both me and you set guidelines and expectations for your research. 

## Reference Manager
I highly recommend you install a reference manager right away. I use [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/?interaction_required=true), but there are others. 

To access journal articles behind paywalls when you are not connected to the UP network, I recommend you connect your [Google Scholar settings to connect to Clark Library](https://libguides.up.edu/remote/resources).

## Document Storage
We will primarily use cloud-based storage for documents such as OneDrive/Google Drive/Dropbox. Try to keep a

## Literature Review
Conducting a literature review on your topic is typically the first step in research. This review can take different shapes but it is essential to have an understanding what has been done in the field and what questions are still out there. 

- Pacheco-Vega, R. (2016). [Literature Reviews](http://www.raulpacheco.org/resources/literature-reviews/). _Several blog posts about the literature review process, including the AIC (Abstract, Intro, Conclusion) reading method._ 

For a formal literature review, in addition to Google Scholar, you may want to search the following databases (you will need your UP username/password):
- [UP Database](https://library.up.edu/)
- [Engineering Village](https://login.ezproxy-eres.up.edu/login?url=http://www.engineeringvillage.com)
- [GreenFILE](https://web-b-ebscohost-com.ezproxy-eres.up.edu/ehost/search/advanced?vid=0&sid=b7d86d33-be90-401f-b5b0-b19e6b58dd34%40pdc-v-sessmgr01)

To check if a journal is peer-reviewed, you can use [Ulrich's Web](https://login.ezproxy-eres.up.edu/login?url=https://ulrichsweb.serialssolutions.com/)

# Open Science
I am committed to open science research -- meaning taking every step to ensure our work is openly shared and available as much as possible. Here are a few resources.
 - Bakker (2019). [Data-Sharing Requires Script-Sharing](http://doi.org/10.1111/gwat.12852). _A compelling argument for sharing not just data, but scripts._
 - Chief et al. (2016). [Engaging Southwestern Tribes in Sustainable Water Resources Topics and Management](http://doi.org/10.3390/w8080350). _Essential reading for developing collaborative research with Indigenous communities (and relevant to collaborative research with any stakeholder group)._
 - Flint et al. (2017). [Data Management Dimensions of Social Water Science: The iUTAH Experience](http://doi.org/10.1111/1752-1688.12568). _Excellent example of sharing diverse datasets associated with a project._
 - Lowndes et al. (2017). [Our path to better science in less time using open data science tools](http://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-017-0160). _Example of a successful reproducible worklow for a large collaborative project._
 - Stall et al. (2017). [Enabling FAIR Data Across the Earth and Space Sciences](http://doi.org/10.1029/2017EO088425). _[AGU](http://agu.org/) is my primary professional affiliation and these are their data standards (which are widely used)._
